Overview

We would like to examine a potential new hire's coding ability. As such we'll be sending junior developers the 
following homework assignment provided they meet our expectations during the first interview or two. The data for 
the assignment should be generated by running the following command in the console: 
curl "https://api.mockaroo.com/api/56f3ef90?count=1000&key=56d2e1c0" > "salesdata.csv" 

Assignment
At the moment, we are an AWS centric organization. As such the ability to comfortably navigate the environment and 
solve problems within this framework is important. This assignment will require you to set up a personal (free) account 
with Amazon Web Services (https://portal.aws.amazon.com/billing/signup#/start)

The resources you create will fall under the free-tier of AWS's usage, but we will also note which utilities you should 
be sure to turn off when not in use to avoid any accidental charges.

The first phase of the assignment is to set up a database of your choice in Amazon RDS, Make sure you have a SQL client 
that is able to interface with this database. Make sure to stop the database when not in use.

In the programming language of your choice (preferably Python), create a solution to load the attached employee sales 
data into the RDS database you have stood up. If there are any erroneous records, they are to be skipped and logged to 
the user for review. The DB structure should be normalized

Once loaded determine the following
- Sales person with highest sales
- Sales department with highest sales in 2017
- Average sales per month for all employees
- Total sales amount for each sales person in descending order

Provide the answer to the above questions as well as the source code for the data loader and the SQL statements for 
determining the answers. Source code can be provided in a repository of your choice like github
